I need help with analyzing the following task requirement , and develop me plans how to build the ai agent as specified. Use the lates information from NLWeb repository (https://github.com/nlweb-ai/NLWeb) and related materials. AI Agent Development with NLWEb and OpenAI API Summary We are seeking a talented and reliable developer to build a proof-of-concept AI agent that leverages both NLWeb and the OpenAI API. This is a short-term engagement designed to quickly showcase what’s possible with these technologies working together, with the strong potential for future collaboration on more advanced projects. Project Overview: The primary objective is to create a demo application where a simple AI agent can accept natural language queries via NLWeb, process them using OpenAI’s API, and return relevant, contextual replies. The project will serve as a demonstration of the agent's conversational capabilities and showcase the integration of NLWeb’s web-focused context enrichment with the intelligence of OpenAI’s models. Responsibilities: - Set up a development environment for NLWeb and the OpenAI API, ensuring API key and environment variable security. - Implement core backend logic in Python or Node.js to connect NLWeb query intake with OpenAI API requests. You will be responsible for building RESTful endpoints that receive user queries, relay them to the OpenAI API, and return clear, formatted responses. - Configure NLWeb to ingest and index website content or structured datasets (e.g., JSONL, Schema.org markup) for contextual reference. - Integrate a simple web front-end or demo UI component that interacts with your backend, so stakeholders can try the agent with live queries. - Adjust OpenAI model parameters—such as temperature and response length—to fit the demo’s goals, and handle edge cases such as incomplete queries and API errors. - Provide concise documentation and setup instructions so that others can run or extend the demo easily. Required Skills & Experience: - Demonstrated experience in API integration, especially working with cloud-based AI APIs like OpenAI. - Solid development background in Python or Node.js, including RESTful API setup and secure handling of credentials. - Hands-on familiarity with NLWeb or similar web content ingestion and search/indexing tools is a bonus. - Past projects building chat-based or conversational agents that interface with LLMs (OpenAI, GPT-3.5/4, etc.). - Clear, consistent coding style and ability to produce project documentation. - Ability to work independently, meet tight deadlines, and communicate progress clearly. What We’re Looking For: - A developer who can rapidly prototype and iterate, building a demo within days, not weeks. - Someone who thrives on turning concepts into real working code, not just providing working examples. - Candidates with a portfolio or references around AI chatbot or agent projects will stand out. - If the POC is successful and we work well together, there is significant opportunity for a continued partnership on larger AI system builds and enhancements. How to Apply: Send a brief message outlining your experience with OpenAI, conversational agent design, or NLWeb integration. Please include samples of relevant work and your expected timeline for delivering an initial POC. Let us know your availability for a quick kickoff call as soon as possible.
